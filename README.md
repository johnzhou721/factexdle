# FacTeXdle

A factordle.com imitation written in LaTeX utilizing ``expl3``. This is written in early September
2024 with some improvements to the messages and other cleanups applied at time of commit.

## Purpose

You will be given an expression to factor and will have 1 guess to enter the correct factorization, seperated
in components in a format given on the terminal.  This is essentially the same as https://factordle.com/, but
in that web application you get multiple guesses and also customization in the format.  You will not get this
in this application, but the benefit is that you can run it on the command line, and it is as a case of abusing
TeX, which is actually a typesetting system.

## Note
One guess only.

This project is not associated with the original factordle.com in any way.
